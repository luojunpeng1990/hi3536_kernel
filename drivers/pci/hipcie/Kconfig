	As to the PCIe address space configuration, address space for all EPs
	is up to 256Mbytes. But, normally people do not used that much. Each
	EP device will use 4Kbytes virtual address space for PCIe configuration header.
	Normally people will not use that much(256MB).
	Enlarge this value will require more system virtual address space.
	The DEFAULT value(8MB) is enough for most applications.

	The default max read request size of pcie device is 512 Byte. When you use
	the card of pcie-to-sata to connect to the sata disk, with the default max read
	request size value of 512 byte, would cause the low bandwidth of VDP. If you enable

	set to 128 byte, and the problem of VDP low band width also be avoided.
